# cloud-and-on-premise-security-plan
<b>A case study to develop a cloud and on-premise security plan.</b> <br>
A client’s consists of both on-premise functionality as well as public cloud solutions, we needed to ensure that security is at the forefront on the design.<br>
As an accounting company, they must ensure that it complies to all financial regulations, together with satisfying all GDPR policies – especially around the storage and security of customer’s data.<br>
It is stipulated that all customer data around financial records must be kept for a minimum of 10 years, as before - with enterprise customers (companies of more than 5,000 employees) data being retained for a minimum of 15 years.<br>
With security in mind, our manager has asked me to make a thorough investigation of our client’s existing on-premise and cloud-based architecture.  My recommendations on how the networks can be improved made me consider the following:<br>
•	Security of on-premise network environment, cloud environment, and connections between the two. All data at rest and in transit should be secured to at least 256-bit length.<br>
•	A secure strategy for data transfer, though this needs to accommodate both ‘connected/on-line’ and ‘off-line’ transfer.<br>
•	Adoption of current on-premise security around key management into the cloud. The on-premises and cloud solution must meet FIPS 140-2 Level 3 compliance.<br>
•	A Role Based Access Control strategy for your chosen cloud solution offering designated permission to the following roles for members of the IT Security department (preferably with pre-defined permissions):<br>
&nbsp;o	Storage<br>
&nbsp;o	Database Management<br>
&nbsp;o	Security<br>
&nbsp;o	Auditing<br>
&nbsp;o	VM management<br>
•	Disaster planning including High Availability/Fault Tolerance.<br>
•	Recommendations on ‘Tabletop’ or ‘Game Day exercises’.<br>
•	Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack protection for any solutions migrated to your cloud provider of choice.<br>
